            Coming soon: an introductory ebook and a practitioner training course. The ebook will present Sacred Psychology as an accessible framework for understanding emotional experience, while the practitioner course will provide a structured path for those who wish to study and apply Sacred Psychology in personal or professional contexts. Students will learn to integrate emotional patterns, trauma insight, and spiritual meaning into their work — cultivating ethical, grounded, and embodied presence.

            Most modern mental health systems are built on diagnostic frameworks like the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), designed to identify, categorize, and treat symptoms such as anxiety, depression, panic, and trauma. While these systems have helped many, they often frame human suffering primarily as disorder, overlooking the deeper meaning in emotional experience, nervous system sensitivity, and spiritual crisis.

          <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">
            Sacred Psychology offers a different lens.
          </p>

          <p>
            It does not reject psychology or neuroscience — it expands them. Instead of asking, "What is wrong with you?" Sacred Psychology asks, "What is this experience trying to communicate?"
          </p>

          <p>
            Rather than separating mind and soul, Sacred Psychology integrates:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-800">
            <li>nervous system regulation</li>
            <li>trauma-informed therapy</li>
            <li>emotional processing</li>
            <li>spiritual meaning</li>
            <li>energetic awareness</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8">
            From this perspective:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-800">
            <li>Anxiety becomes heightened sensitivity to environment and threat, not just malfunction.</li>
            <li>Depression can be a protective withdrawal response, not only a chemical imbalance.</li>
            <li>Addictive patterns often reflect attempts to regulate overwhelming internal states, rather than moral failure.</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mt-8">
            This approach mirrors medical and psychological models through a symbolic and spiritual lens, allowing experiences to be understood as both biologically rooted and meaning-laden. Modern research in trauma, neuroplasticity, the vagus nerve, and somatic healing is finally catching up to what ancient spiritual traditions long recognized: the body holds memory, and true healing requires more than insight alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sacred Psychology exists at the intersection of psychology and mysticism, diagnosis and destiny, symptom and signal. Many individuals labeled as "disordered" are, in fact:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4 text-gray-800">
            <li>Highly sensitive nervous systems</li>
            <li>Deeply perceptive minds</li>
            <li>Emotionally attuned bodies</li>
            <li>Individuals shaped by prolonged stress or trauma</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mt-8">
            Rather than being broken, they are often overloaded. Sacred Psychology does not reject therapy — it restores meaning to experience. Just as True Sidereal Astrology reconnects astrology to the real sky, Sacred Psychology reconnects mental health to the lived inner world — where emotion, biology, memory, and meaning meet.

            True Sky Psychology integrates 13-Sign True Sidereal astrology with modern psychology, ancestral wisdom, and energy work. Our mission is to help people understand themselves through the real sky — the actual astronomical positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets — and to translate that truth into emotional, psychological, and energetic healing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We believe that healing is full-spectrum — the body, mind, energy field, environment, and sky all influence one another. By combining astrology with nervous system awareness, somatic practices, and Sacred Psychology principles, we empower people to understand their blueprint, regulate their frequency, and transform their lives.
